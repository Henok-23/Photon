# Photon
Linux Desktop Assistant, currently available only on for Ubuntu
you can try on other distro it might work but I haven't tried it yet
I will release for other distro in future!


This version is for demo purpose only and gauge interest. You can only install few apps, few commands and may have bugs. However, I will try my best to make it better with each and every release!

Photon is linux desktop assistant that open your apps from voice or text instruction and install common apps like chrome from text instruction.

This is beta version and my first release, I plan to integrate photon with email, calendar, slack etc.

Its mainly task focused like automating boring stuff on linux and local. 

Please check my website photondesktop.com to download and try it!
