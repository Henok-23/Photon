# Photon

This version is for demo purpose only and gauge interest to know if its product worth investing lots of time, you can only install few apps, few commands and has lots of bugs I will try to make it better with each and every release!e
Linux Desktop Assistant, currently only beta versions for Ubuntu, you can try on other distro it might work but I haven't tried it yet! I will release for other distro in future!

Photon is linux desktop assistant that open your apps from voice or text instruction and install common apps like chrome from text instruction.

This is beta version and my first release, I plan to integrate photon with email, calendar, slack etc.

Its mainly task focused like automating boring stuff on linux and local. 

Please check  my website photondesktop.com to download and try it!
