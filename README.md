# Photon
Linux Desktop Assistant, currently only beta versions for Ubuntu, you can try on other distro it might work but I haven't tried it yet! We will expand to other distros on upcomimg versions

Photon is linux desktop assistant that open your apps from voice or text instruction and install common apps like chrome from text instruction. This is beta version and my first release, I plan to integrate photon with email, calendar, slack etc.
