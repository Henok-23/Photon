# Photon
Linux Desktop Assistant

Tested only on Ubuntu, should work on all major Linux distros with Flatpak support

you can try on other distro it might work but I haven't tried it yet. I will release for other distros in future!


This version is for demo purpose only and gauge interest. You can only install few apps, few commands and may have bugs.

Photon is linux desktop assistant that open your apps from voice or text instruction and install common apps like chrome from text instruction. Its mainly task focused and local. 


This is beta version and my first release, I plan to integrate photon with email, calendar, slack etc. 

Please check my website photondesktop.com to download and try it!
